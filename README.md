# hello-world
 Hello,
 I am a girl, and I do not want to say my name.
 I am doing google code-in, I love working with google, and using the code-in!
 My progress is doing very well in google code in!
 Some facts about me:
 My favroite food is spaghetti with corn mixed with mashed potatos!
 My hobbies are sewing, taking photo of wildlife, and drawing!
 I do not have any pets... although I want a dog!
 This is all me!
